# ktmm (Keep That Mouse Moving!) - Java Version

This works the same as the [Python version](https://github.com/ao/ktmm), but written in Java so that it's cross platform.

You can use it as follows:

```
# Step1: Download https://github.com/ao/ktmm-java/raw/master/target/ktmm-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Step2: Then run:
java -jar ktmm-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
